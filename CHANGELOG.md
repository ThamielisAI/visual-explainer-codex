### 🚀 The Next-Level Aesthetic Overhaul
`visual-explainer-extension` is forked from the original `visual-explainer` repository and re-engineered for striking visual quality and technical sophistication.

- **Rebranding**: Project renamed to `visual-explainer-extension`.
- **Design Engineering Mandate**: Re-engineered `SKILL.md` with a senior designer persona, strict aesthetic rules, and a "Design Tokens" first workflow.
- **Advanced CSS Orchestration**:
  - **CSS Layers**: Implemented `@layer reset, theme, layout, components, animation` for bulletproof specificity management.
  - **Container Queries**: Replaced static media queries with `@container` queries, allowing cards to adapt based on their grid placement.
  - **Design Token System**: Centralized all design variables into a robust token system in `css-patterns.md`.
- **Sophisticated Typography**: 
  - Updated `libraries.md` with 5 curated "High-Character" pairings (Blueprint, Editorial, Modernist, Organic, Brutalist).
  - Strictly forbade "AI-slop" fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial).
- **Interactive Visual Components**:
  - **Intent Bridge**: New pattern for mapping user intent/natural language directly to code implementations.
  - **Archetype Cards**: Large-format modular cards with AI-generated icon integration.
  - **Enhanced Code Windows**: Sophisticated IDE-like code blocks with file tabs and premium syntax highlighting.
- **Aesthetic Recipes**: Added high-fidelity CSS recipes for **Blueprint** (technical), **Editorial** (premium serif), and **Paper/Ink** (organic) modes.
- **New Master Template**: Rewrote `architecture.html` as a state-of-the-art reference demonstrating theme cycling and advanced layout techniques.
- **Anti-Slop Enforcement**: Integrated a hard-enforcement checklist to prevent generic patterns (no indigo gradients, no emoji headers, no unstructured dumps).
